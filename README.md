Review at the end of the project:

The project took longer to finish than I expected. I had a lot of difficulty with the different
flex elements in terms of when a flex property is inserted where or what will it
affect. In the process I learnt a new sizing terms.

At the end of reviewing this project I realized some mistakes in my website. Firstly, when the
page is minimized the logo in the first section moves to the right and is not aligned with the small
section below it. Secondly,the text in the section before the footer has the same situation. I tried to fix to
fix it but I was having some trouble doing do. It's still not fixed but I will fix it in the future, hopefully
