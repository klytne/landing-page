# landing-page
The project is about creating a landing page website using flexbox

Skills obtained:
<ul>
<li>creating columns without the use of tables</li>
<li>having a better layout of the website</li>
<li>designing links and lists</li>
<li>making the website responsive</li>
</ul>

Review at the end of the project:

The project took longer to finish than I expected. I had a lot of difficulty with the different
flex elements in terms of when a flex property is inserted where or what will it
affect. In the process I learnt a new sizing term.
